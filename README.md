MYOB Sample project
-------------------

To run the Console Application, just build the project in Visual Studio and the required Newtonsoft.Json Nuget Package will be automatically downloaded.
The Newtonsoft.Json package is used for reading the Inputfile and also for generating the result file.
Once builded, you should run the file using the following command: MYOB.MonthlyPayslip.exe InputFile.json outputFile.json

A sample json file is included in the solution.
